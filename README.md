# Sahayak
* ## Problem
If you work on data solutions, we always need to work with data available in excels and csv. To analyse the data and understand so many stories from the data is what is expected.
To do that exploring the data in MS is not a good choice. The only option is to load the data onto some database and then analyse it using the power of SQL. 
But not always a database environment is available with us. So things become complicated.

* ## Solution
To address all the problems mentioned above, which were also my problem daily, I started working on a solution. Using python and SQLite3 I have created a solution,
that helps me execute SQL queries on the excel/csv data. That's a relief. So it started as a personal project and grew to a complete solution, now sharing with all.

* ## Description
Sahayak is a simple tool, created using Python GUI tkinter. It lets you load the excel/csv files, converts the data to a SQLite table and lets you write queries to explore the data.
Everything happens in the local system, so DB environment dependency is avoided, also at the same time, since everything is on the local system, so no concern about the data security or breach of any policy.
The executable needs no installation, just download the executable and start executing it.
